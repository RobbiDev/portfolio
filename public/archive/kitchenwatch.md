# SafelySDS

SafelySDS is a digital solution for managing Safety Data Sheets (SDS) in industries like manufacturing and food service. The goal was to build a platform that’s fast, easy to use, and scalable — helping teams store critical safety documents with confidence.

## Project Overview

Built for internal use at Virtuollis and later expanded into a SaaS platform, SafelySDS allows users to upload, search, and manage SDS documents securely. It was designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, especially for non-technical users who need fast access to information.

## Results

The system made document retrieval over **4x faster**, eliminated cluttered filing cabinets, and improved compliance readiness for safety audits.

- 50+ SDS files uploaded during beta
- 100% user satisfaction among internal testers
- Transition-ready for external clients

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Handling large PDF files across devices  
  **Solution**: Leveraged Azure Blob Storage with progressive loading

- **Challenge**: User-friendly search/filter UX  
  **Solution**: Custom-built search bar with filter by category, name, and upload date

- **Challenge**: Seamless integration with internal tools  
  **Solution**: Modular architecture and REST API layer

> Keeping the interface minimal yet powerful helped it stay accessible to all users, especially in fast-paced factory environments.

## Conclusion

SafelySDS represents a critical step toward digitizing compliance and document management. Its clean design and reliable backend make it a perfect fit for industries with strict safety regulations — and it lays the foundation for future enhancements like multi-tenant support and offline access.
