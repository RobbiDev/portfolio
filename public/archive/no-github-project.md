# No GitHub Project Example

This project demonstrates how the portfolio system handles projects without a GitHub repository link. Notice that the "View Code" button is not displayed in the project header, while the "View Live" button is still present.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this example is to show that UI elements in the portfolio system can be conditionally rendered based on the available data. This creates a cleaner, more focused presentation that only shows relevant information to visitors.

## When to Omit GitHub Links

There are several scenarios where you might want to omit a GitHub link:

1. **Client Projects** - When code repositories are private due to client agreements
2. **Proprietary Work** - For projects where the code cannot be shared publicly
3. **Simple Demonstrations** - For concept projects where the code isn't the focus
4. **Work in Progress** - For projects still under development

## Benefits of Conditional UI

Conditional UI elements provide several benefits:

- **Cleaner Interface** - Only showing relevant actions to users
- **Focused Attention** - Directing users to the most important actions
- **Flexible Content** - Accommodating different types of projects with varying available information

This example project demonstrates how the portfolio system intelligently adapts to the available data, creating a seamless experience regardless of what information is provided for each project.
