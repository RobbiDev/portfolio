# Example Blog Post

This is a sample blog post that demonstrates how to use the markdown parser with metadata.

## Features

- Metadata extraction from custom delimiters
- Markdown to HTML conversion
- TypeScript support
- Error handling

## Code Example

\`\`\`javascript
// Example code block
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
\`\`\`

## How It Works

The parser extracts metadata from between the `===` delimiters and parses the remaining content as Markdown.

> This is a blockquote that shows formatting is preserved.
