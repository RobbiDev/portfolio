# Blog Post with Working Images

This blog post demonstrates how embedded images work properly in blog content.

## Featured Image Example

Here's an embedded image that should display correctly:

![Sample blog image](/safelysds.png)

## Content with Multiple Images

Blog posts can include multiple images throughout the content:

![Design process illustration](/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=800&query=design process steps)

Each image is properly rendered with responsive sizing and optimization.

## Image Captions

While Markdown doesn't natively support captions, you can add descriptive text below images:

![Data visualization chart](/placeholder.svg?height=600&width=800&query=data visualization chart)

*This chart shows the improvement in user engagement after implementing visual content.*

## Conclusion

With the fixed Markdown component, images now render properly in both projects and blog posts, creating a more engaging visual experience.
