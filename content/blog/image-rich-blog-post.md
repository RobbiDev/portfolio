## Why Visual Content Matters

Visual content helps break up text, illustrates complex concepts, and creates a more engaging user experience:

Studies show that people remember 65% of information when paired with a relevant image, compared to just 10% without visual aids.

## Types of Images to Include

Different types of images serve different purposes in your content:

### 1. Featured Images

Featured images create the first impression and should capture the essence of your content:

## Optimizing Images for Web

Properly optimized images improve page load times and user experience:

1. **Resize images** to the appropriate dimensions before uploading
2. **Compress files** to reduce size without sacrificing quality
3. **Use appropriate formats** (JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics with transparency)
4. **Add descriptive alt text** for accessibility and SEO

## Image Placement Strategy

Strategic image placement enhances readability and engagement:

1. **Place images near relevant text** they support or illustrate
2. **Break up long sections** of text with images
3. **Align images consistently** throughout your content
4. **Consider mobile users** and how images will appear on smaller screens

## Legal Considerations

Always ensure you have the right to use the images in your content:

1. **Use royalty-free stock photos** from reputable sites
2. **Create your own images** when possible
3. **Properly attribute** images when required
4. **Understand licensing terms** before using any image
