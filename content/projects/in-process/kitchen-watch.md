# KitchenWatch Project Outline



## Results & Future Plans

SafelySDS successfully moved the facility from a disorganized paper system to a modern digital standard. It has significantly lowered safety risks by making information faster to find and easier to manage. Moving forward, the goal is to scale this into a full "Software as a Service" (SaaS) model so other companies can fix their safety "dark ages" too.
