# Welcome 👋

Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find the code and assets for my professional portfolio website. Coding has been my passion since I was 9 years old—I vividly remember what started it all and it as accidentally discovering what the inspect button did on Coolmath Games! 😄

This portfolio marks my first step in showcasing my work. As a full-stack engineer, I excel in backend development while continuously refining my frontend design skills. While I acknowledge areas for improvement in design, I'm dedicated to honing these skills with each project.

This portfolio reflects my current capabilities and represents the beginning of my professional journey. Thank you for visiting, and I'm eager to share more of my work with you!
